# üîê Security Audit Report - RaveCapture Cancellation Form
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit of the Supabase database revealed **critical security vulnerabilities** that exposed sensitive user data. All issues have been identified and fixes have been prepared.

### Severity: **CRITICAL** üî¥

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. ‚ùå No Row Level Security (RLS) Enabled
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** All database tables were publicly accessible

**Affected Tables:**
- `cancellation_submissions` - Contains user emails and submission data
- `cancellation_feedback` - Contains sensitive user feedback
- `cancellation_retention` - Contains retention offer responses  
- `cancellation_education_events` - Contains user analytics
- `email_logs` - Contains email tracking data

**Risk:**
- Anyone with the anon key (visible in client-side code) could read ALL data
- User emails and personal information were publicly exposed
- Potential GDPR/privacy compliance violations

### 2. ‚ùå API Routes Using Anon Key Instead of Service Role
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** API routes were using the public anon key for database operations

**Affected Files:**
- `/src/app/api/submissions/route.ts` - Used `supabase` instead of `supabaseAdmin`
- `/src/lib/database.ts` - Only exported anon client

**Risk:**
- API operations would be blocked once RLS is enabled
- Inconsistent security model

### 3. ‚ùå No RLS Policies
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Even with RLS enabled, no policies existed to restrict access

---

## Fixes Implemented

### ‚úÖ Migration 1: Enable RLS (`20251017000000_enable_rls_security.sql`)
- Enabled Row Level Security on all 5 tables
- Added basic policies framework

### ‚úÖ Migration 2: Secure Policies (`20251017000001_secure_rls_policies.sql`)
- **Blocked ALL anonymous access to database tables**
- All database operations MUST go through API routes
- API routes use service role key (bypasses RLS)
- This is the correct security model for this application

**Why This Approach:**
- Users don't authenticate (it's a cancellation form)
- All access goes through controlled API endpoints
- API validates requests and uses service role for database operations
- No direct database access from client side

### ‚úÖ Code Fix: Updated API Routes
**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Now exports both `supabase` and `supabaseAdmin`
- `src/app/api/submissions/route.ts` - Changed to use `supabaseAdmin` throughout
- Added null checks for `supabaseAdmin`

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Review Migrations
```bash
cat supabase/migrations/20251017000000_enable_rls_security.sql
cat supabase/migrations/20251017000001_secure_rls_policies.sql
```

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes
The following files have been updated and need to be deployed:
- `src/lib/database.ts`
- `src/app/api/submissions/route.ts`

### Step 3: Push Migrations to Supabase
```bash
cd /Users/wadeshome/ravecapture-cancellation-form

# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Manually in Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to Database > SQL Editor
# 2. Copy and paste each migration file
# 3. Execute them in order
```

### Step 4: Verify Security
```bash
# Test that anonymous access is blocked
node check-rls-detailed.js

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ RLS ENABLED - Properly secured (for all tables)
```

### Step 5: Test Your Application
1. Visit your cancellation form
2. Fill out and submit the form
3. Verify it still works (API routes should function normally)
4. Check browser console for any errors

---

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** 
- Never commit `.env` file to git
- Service role key should ONLY be used server-side
- Anon key can be public (it's in client-side code)

---

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] All migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Code deployed to production
- [ ] Security test script shows RLS enabled
- [ ] Form submission works correctly
- [ ] No errors in production logs
- [ ] Anonymous access to tables is blocked
- [ ] API routes can still read/write data

## Additional Recommendations

### Short Term (Recommended)
1. ‚úÖ **Completed:** Enable RLS on all tables
2. ‚úÖ **Completed:** Block anonymous direct access
3. ‚úÖ **Completed:** Use service role in API routes
4. üî≤ **TODO:** Add rate limiting to API endpoints
5. üî≤ **TODO:** Add input validation middleware
6. üî≤ **TODO:** Set up monitoring/alerts for failed requests

### Long Term (Optional)
1. Consider implementing user authentication
2. Add audit logging for sensitive operations
3. Implement data retention policies
4. Set up automated security scanning
5. Regular security audits every quarter
